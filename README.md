## Usability Testing & Iteration ✅

**Test Setup:**

- 10 participants via remote testing  
- Task: Locate and open a "Midterm Summary" note  
- Duration: 15–20 minutes per session  

**Findings:**

- Initial task success rate: 30% ❌  
- Pain points: small note cards, unclear action icons, navigation confusion  

**Improvements:**

- Grid layout → Single-column list 📝  
- Card size: 24px → 44px touch target ✋  
- Action icons → Icons with text labels ("Read", "Download")  
- Enhanced color contrast, font size, semantic labels 🎨  

**Result:** Task success rate improved from **30% → 80%** ✅  

---

## Impact & Results 📈

- **Task Success Rate:** 30% → 80% (+167%)  
- **Time on Task:** 4–5 min → 1–2 min ⏱  
- **User Satisfaction:** "I can now find trustworthy notes in half the time" 💯
